+      Version:
+        description: >
+          Describes a specific version of an entity.
+
+
+          A version is defined as a revision or iteration of what is
+          otherwise the same logical entity. If supported by a manager,
+          versions are created when new data is published to an existing
+          entity. Not all managers may version all types of entity.
+
+
+          There is no requirement for version to be a singular atomic
+          series, managers may wish to support "meta versions", such as
+          'vLatest' or similar, or provide multiple parallel versioning
+          streams.
+
+
+          This trait can be used in several places:
+           - When resolved, the manager should provide information about
+             the version of the referenced entity. This trait should only 
+             be imbued if the target entity is considered versioned by the
+             manager, and it can populate the stableTag property.
+           - When responding to managementPolicy for an entity trait set,
+             the manager should imbue this trait if that type of entity
+             is version managed by the manager (not all managers version
+             all types of entity).
+           - When used within a relationship query, this trait indicates
+             that the returned entities should be constrained to other
+             versions of the logical entity targeted by the reference.
+        usage:
+          - entity
+          - relationship
+          - managementPolicy
+        properties:
+          specifiedTag:
+            type: string
+            description: >
+              An unambiguous identifier (tag) for the specific version of 
+              an entity targeted by a specific reference.
+
+
+              Examples of version tags include "1", "v2", "latest".
+
+
+              If the reference itself does not contain a version
+              specifier and relies on dynamic behaviour, then this should
+              be left empty.
+          stableTag:
+            type: string
+            description: >
+              The tag (see 'specifiedTag') targeted by the reference once
+              meta-versions or other dynamic behaviour is applied.
+
+
+              If, for example, references without an explicit version
+              yield the most recent, then this should be set to
+              the tag of that version. When referencing some other
+              semantic state (eg. approval), this should be set to the
+              tag of the concrete version that matches the specific
+              state.
+
+
+              Examples of stable version tags include "1", "v2".
+
+
+              This property should always be set when the Version trait
+              is imbued as part of a resolve response. If the entity is
+              not versioned, then the trait itself should not be imbued.
+      Stable:
+        description: >
+          Defines that the entity references returned from a
+          relationship query with this trait should be devoid of any
+          dynamic behaviour. This includes concepts such as
+          meta-versioning or context-specific variation that results
+          logically different data being supplied.
+
 
+          This is generally used to snapshot/bookmark specific
+          configurations to avoid temporal instability and/or ensure
+          processes are repeatable.
 
+
+          Note: This does not include variations such as regional
