Supporting time-based calculations as well makes the code significantly more complex. We chose to avoid this extra complexity by sticking solely to date-based mathematics.\n\nThe `add_business_days` method is used to perform business day arithmetic on dates.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Thursday, 12 June 2014")\ncalendar.add_business_days(input_date, 4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Wednesday, 18 June 2014"\ncalendar.add_business_days(input_date, -4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"\n```\n\nThe `roll_forward` and `roll_backward` methods snap a date to a nearby business day. If provided with a business day, they will return that date. Otherwise, they will advance (forward for `roll_forward` and backward for `roll_backward`) until a business day is found.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Saturday, 14 June 2014")\ncalendar.roll_forward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Monday, 16 June 2014"\ncalendar.roll_backward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Friday, 13 June 2014"\n```\n\nIn contrast, the `next_business_day` and `previous_business_day` methods will always move to a next or previous date until a business day is found, regardless if the input provided is a business day.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Monday, 9 June 2014")\ncalendar.roll_forward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Monday, 09 June 2014"\ncalendar.next_business_day(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Tuesday, 10 June 2014"\ncalendar.previous_business_day(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")\n# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"\n```\n\nTo count the number of business days between two dates, pass the dates to `business_days_between`. This method counts from start of the first date to start of the second date. So, assuming no holidays, there would be two business days between a Monday and a Wednesday.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Saturday, 14 June 2014")\ncalendar.business_days_between(input_date, input_date + timedelta(days=7))\n# => 5\n```\n\nThe `get_business_day_of_month` method return the running total of business days for a given date in that month. This method counts the number of business days from the start of the first day of the month to the given input date.\n\n```python\ninput_date = Calendar.parse_date("Thursday, 12 June 2014")\ncalendar.get_business_day_of_month(input_date)\n# => 9\n```\n## License & Contributing\n\n- This is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n- Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/gocardless/business-python.\n\nGoCardless â™¥ open source.

+Date calculations based on business calendars. (Python 3.8+)
 
+Python implementation of https://github.com/gocardless/business
+
+## Documentation
+
+To get business, simply:
+
+```bash
+$ pip install business-python
+```
+
+## Version 2.1.0 breaking changes
+
+In version 2.1.0 we have dropped support for End-of-Life Python version 3.6 and 3.7. Last release supporting these versions is [v2.0.3](https://github.com/gocardless/business-python/tree/v2.0.3).
+
+## Version 2.0.0 breaking changes

+
+### Migration
+
+- Download/create calendars to a directory within your project eg: `lib/calendars`
+- Change your code to include the `load_path` for your calendars
+- Continue using `.load("my_calendar")` as usual
+
+```python
+# lib/calendars contains yml files
+Calendar.load_paths = ['lib/calendars']
+calendar = Calendar.load("my_calendar")
+```
+
+### Getting started
+
+Get started with business by creating an instance of the calendar class, passing in a hash that specifies which days of the week are considered working days, and which days are holidays.
+
+```python
+from business.calendar import Calendar
+
+calendar = Calendar(
+  working_days=["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
+  # array items are either parseable date strings, or real datetime.date objects
+  holidays=["January 1st, 2020", "April 10th, 2020"],
+  extra_working_dates=[],
+)
+```
+
+`extra_working_dates` key makes the calendar to consider a weekend day as a working day.
+
+If `working_days` is missing, then common default is used (mon-fri).
+If `holidays` is missing, "no holidays" assumed.
+If `extra_working_dates` is missing, then no changes in `working_days` will happen.
+
+Elements of `holidays` and `extra_working_dates` may be either strings that `Calendar.parse_date()` can understand, or YYYY-MM-DD (which is considered as a Date by Python YAML itself).
+
+#### Calendar YAML file example
+
+```yaml
+# lib/calendars/my_calendar.yml
+working_days:
+  - Monday
+  - Sunday
+holidays:
+  - 2017-01-08 # Same as January 8th, 2017
+extra_working_dates:
+  - 2020-12-26 # Will consider 26 Dec 2020 (A Saturday), a working day
+```
+
+The `load_cache` method allows a thread safe way to avoid reloading the same calendar multiple times, and provides a performant way to dynamically load calendars for different requests.
+
+#### Using business-python
+
+Define your calendars in a folder eg: `lib/calendars` and set this directory on `Calendar.load_paths=`
+
+```python
+Calendar.load_paths = ['lib/calendars']
+calendar = Calendar.load_cache("my_calendar")
+```
+
+### Input data types
+
+The `parse_date` method is used to process the input date(s) in each method and return a `datetime.date` object.
+
+```python
+Calendar.parse_date("2019-01-01")
+# => datetime.date(2019, 1, 1)
+```
+
+Supported data types are:
+
+- `datetime.date`
+- `datetime.datetime`
+- `pandas.Timestamp` (treated as `datetime.datetime`)
+- date string parseable by [`dateutil.parser.parse`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html#dateutil.parser.parse)
+
+`numpy.datetime64` is not supported, but can be converted to `datetime.date`:
+
+```python
+numpy.datetime64('2014-06-01T23:00:05.453000000').astype('M8[D]').astype('O')
+# =>  datetime.date(2014, 6, 1)
+```
+
+### Checking for business days
+
+To check whether a given date is a business day (falls on one of the specified working days or extra working dates, and is not a holiday), use the `is_business_day` method on `Calendar`.
+
+```python
+calendar.is_business_day("Monday, 8 June 2020")
+# => true
+calendar.is_business_day("Sunday, 7 June 2020")
+# => false
+```
+
+### Business day arithmetic
+
+> For our purposes, date-based calculations are sufficient. Supporting time-based calculations as well makes the code significantly more complex. We chose to avoid this extra complexity by sticking solely to date-based mathematics.
+
+The `add_business_days` method is used to perform business day arithmetic on dates.
+
+```python
+input_date = Calendar.parse_date("Thursday, 12 June 2014")
+calendar.add_business_days(input_date, 4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Wednesday, 18 June 2014"
+calendar.add_business_days(input_date, -4).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"
+```
+
+The `roll_forward` and `roll_backward` methods snap a date to a nearby business day. If provided with a business day, they will return that date. Otherwise, they will advance (forward for `roll_forward` and backward for `roll_backward`) until a business day is found.
+
+```python
+input_date = Calendar.parse_date("Saturday, 14 June 2014")
+calendar.roll_forward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Monday, 16 June 2014"
+calendar.roll_backward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Friday, 13 June 2014"
+```
+
+In contrast, the `next_business_day` and `previous_business_day` methods will always move to a next or previous date until a business day is found, regardless if the input provided is a business day.
+
+```python
+input_date = Calendar.parse_date("Monday, 9 June 2014")
+calendar.roll_forward(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Monday, 09 June 2014"
+calendar.next_business_day(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Tuesday, 10 June 2014"
+calendar.previous_business_day(input_date).strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
+# => "Friday, 06 June 2014"
+```
+
+To count the number of business days between two dates, pass the dates to `business_days_between`. This method counts from start of the first date to start of the second date. So, assuming no holidays, there would be two business days between a Monday and a Wednesday.
+
+```python
+from datetime import timedelta
+
+input_date = Calendar.parse_date("Saturday, 14 June 2014")
+calendar.business_days_between(input_date, input_date + timedelta(days=7))
+# => 5
+```
+
+The `get_business_day_of_month` method return the running total of business days for a given date in that month. This method counts the number of business days from the start of the first day of the month to the given input date.
+
+```python
+input_date = Calendar.parse_date("Thursday, 12 June 2014")
+calendar.get_business_day_of_month(input_date)
+# => 9
+```
